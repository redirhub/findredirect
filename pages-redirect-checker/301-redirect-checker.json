  "faqs": [
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "What is a 301 redirect and when should I use it?",
      "answer": "A 301 redirect is a permanent redirect that tells browsers and search engines that a page has permanently moved to a new location. Use 301 redirects when you're permanently moving content, changing domain names, migrating to HTTPS, or consolidating pages. It passes 90-99% of link equity to the new URL, making it the best choice for SEO when content has permanently moved."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "How do 301 redirects affect my SEO rankings?",
      "answer": "301 redirects are the most SEO-friendly redirect type. They pass approximately 90-99% of the original page's link equity (ranking power) to the new URL. While you may see temporary ranking fluctuations for 1-4 weeks as search engines process the changes, properly implemented 301 redirects preserve most of your SEO value and prevent the loss of rankings that would occur with deleted pages or 404 errors."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "What's the difference between 301 and 302 redirects?",
      "answer": "A 301 redirect is permanent and tells search engines to pass link equity and index the new URL. A 302 redirect is temporary and tells search engines the original URL will return, so they should continue indexing it and not pass full link equity. Use 301 for permanent changes like site migrations or URL restructuring. Use 302 only for temporary situations like A/B testing, maintenance pages, or seasonal promotions."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "Can 301 redirect chains hurt my website performance?",
      "answer": "Yes, redirect chains significantly hurt website performance. Each redirect adds latency (typically 100-200ms per hop), increases page load time, and may cause search engines to stop following the chain. For example, if URL A redirects to URL B, which redirects to URL C, visitors and bots must make three requests instead of one. Use our 301 redirect checker to identify chains and eliminate them by redirecting directly to the final destination."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "How long should I keep 301 redirects in place?",
      "answer": "Keep 301 redirects in place indefinitely, or at minimum for 1 year. Search engines need time to discover and process redirects. Backlinks, bookmarks, and cached search results may point to old URLs for years. Removing redirects prematurely results in 404 errors, lost traffic, and degraded user experience. The performance cost of maintaining redirects is minimal compared to the benefits."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "Will 301 redirects slow down my website?",
      "answer": "Yes, each 301 redirect adds a small amount of latency (typically 100-200ms). However, this is usually negligible for end users. The bigger performance issue comes from redirect chains. To minimize impact: avoid redirect chains, update internal links to point directly to final destinations, use server-side redirects (not JavaScript), and use our tool to monitor redirect response times and optimize slow redirects."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "How do I check if my 301 redirect is working correctly?",
      "answer": "Use our 301 redirect checker tool to verify your redirects. Enter your URLs and our tool will show you: the HTTP status code (should be 301), the destination URL, response time, whether there are redirect chains, and complete HTTP headers. You can also use browser developer tools (Network tab) or command-line tools like curl to manually check redirect status codes."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "Can I redirect multiple old URLs to one new URL?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can redirect multiple old URLs to a single new URL using many-to-one redirects. This is common when consolidating content, removing duplicate pages, or merging similar pages into one authoritative resource. However, ensure the new URL contains relevant content for all the old URLs. Redirecting unrelated pages to a single URL can confuse users and may be viewed negatively by search engines."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "Do 301 redirects work for images and files?",
      "answer": "Yes, 301 redirects work for any resource type including images, PDFs, videos, CSS files, JavaScript, and other assets. This is particularly important when changing CDN providers, restructuring asset URLs, or migrating to a new domain. Make sure to redirect all resources, not just HTML pages, to prevent broken images and missing assets that harm user experience."
    },
    {
      "_type": "object",
      "question": "What happens if I change a 301 redirect to point somewhere else?",
      "answer": "You can change where a 301 redirect points, but search engines may take time to recognize the change. Previously built link equity may be partially lost during the transition. It's better to avoid changing redirects frequently. If you must change a redirect destination, monitor the new target URL in Google Search Console to ensure search engines discover and process the update. Users and bots will immediately see the new destination, but SEO effects may take weeks."
