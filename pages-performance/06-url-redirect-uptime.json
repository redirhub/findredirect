      "answer": "Industry standard is 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime per year). Premium services like RedirHub often exceed this with 99.95% or higher uptime guarantees."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often is this uptime data updated?",
      "answer": "We check each service every 5 minutes from multiple locations worldwide. The dashboard displays 24-hour rolling statistics updated hourly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when a redirect service goes down?",
      "answer": "All shortened URLs using that service will fail to redirect, showing error pages to users. This breaks all your links simultaneously until service is restored."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rely on these uptime statistics?",
      "answer": "Yes. Our monitoring is independent and objective, checking real redirect endpoints from multiple global locations. We have no affiliation with any service except RedirHub."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which redirect service has the best uptime?",
      "answer": "Check the live data above. The service with the highest 24-hour uptime percentage and 'Fastest' badge typically demonstrates the best current reliability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do redirect services offer uptime guarantees?",
      "answer": "Most professional services offer SLA guarantees. RedirHub provides a 99.9% uptime SLA with service credits for any breaches. Always review SLA terms before committing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does geographic location affect uptime?",
      "answer": "Services with global CDN infrastructure typically show better uptime worldwide. Our monitoring tests from multiple regions to provide accurate global performance data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I choose the service with highest uptime?",
      "answer": "Uptime is crucial, but also consider features, pricing, support, and your specific needs. A service with 99.95% uptime and poor features may not be ideal for your use case."
    }
